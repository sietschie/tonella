# Concept
The goal is to create a simple music box for toddler. A figurine placed on top of the box activates the mp3. Visual feedback is given using a flashing LED ring.
To keep the interface as simple as possible the box has no buttons beside an on/off switch. Volume is controlled using a special set of control figurines.

The box shall contain several playing modes that can also be changed with a control figurine.

The following modes exist:
* Mode 1: says the name of the object and a plays a typical sound associated with the object
* Mode 2: plays a song

Ideas for further modes:
* story mode: play a longer story.
* quiz mode: play name and sound like in mode 1. Then wait for correct figurine to be placed on top

 
## Inspirations
* [Put'n'Play-Cube](https://hackaday.io/project/26293-putnplay-cube) - most of my design ideas I got from here. But when I used the PN532 rfid module it got quite hot and I switched to a different one.
* [tonuino](https://www.voss.earth/tonuino/) - the first one I found out about. But it lacked 3d printing. Instead it used existing speaker cases and rfid cards for controllng the box.
