# Say Hello to Tonella! ![Tonella with Lion](Screenshot_20200229-225238.jpg?resize=300,300)

My goal is to create an arduino based music box with a tangible user interface and learn some 3d printing and electronics on the way.

## Concept
A general introduction of tonella to introduce the box and describe design choices.

## Code
This section will describe how to use the code that is running on the arduino as well as tools for preparing the sounds.

## Case
The case will be 3d printed. This section will contain the source and stl files as well as assembly instructions.

## Circuit
A board is needed to connect everything together. This section will describe how this board was designed and assembled.

## Figures
To activate sounds a figurine with an embedded 3d chip shall be placed on top of the box. This section will describe how to print and program the figurines.

## Outlook
In this section I will collect ideas and notes for further iterations of the box.
